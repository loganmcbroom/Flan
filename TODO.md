Ideas:
	filter package
	continuity maintenance in wavelength/frequency finders
	octave error minimization in yin-based pitch finder (fast contour finder)
	audio to function of frequency
	convolve constant signals via fft
	Add \mainpage with examples somewhere
	Audio::removeSilence
	Audio::cut uses an extra buffer copy when calling fades, remove it
	contour pitch mean should be magnitude weighted
	only generate docs for flan stuff
	pvoc::alignHarmonics

Task:
	select seems slow, check it out
	select/mix/join should consider bitrate conversion when needed
	delete and rebuild sndfile to make sure it's in release mode
		build in both modes
	compute_d array access crash in AudioInformation - bounds check
 
    export options
		don't do it - it's a waste of time
		yeah
		remove from NodeEditor
		upload both
		test Loton build
